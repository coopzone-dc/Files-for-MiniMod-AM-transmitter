This is not a software project. These files are for people who want to have a go at building a version of the Mini-Mod project
recently published in Vintage-Radio.net by Peter Matthews. My many thanks to his original work.

The various versions, released over time, can be found in the sub folders listed.

The circuit and artwork are also published on https://oshwlab.com/mycoopzone/test_copy
