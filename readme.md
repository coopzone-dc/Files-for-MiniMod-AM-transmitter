This is not a software project. These files are for people who want to have a go at building a version of the Mini-Mod project
recently published in Vintage-Radio.net by Peter Matthews. My many thanks to his original work.

The circuit and artwork are also published on https://oshwlab.com/mycoopzone/test_copy
