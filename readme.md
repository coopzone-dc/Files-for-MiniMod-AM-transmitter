This is not a software project.

These files are for people who want to have a go at building a version of the Mini-Mod project, originally designed by Ian Liston-Smith. The design was published in the BVWS. See BVWS Bulletin vol 36, number 4 Winter 2011. (https://www.bvws.org.uk/publications/bulletins.php/volume36number4).

There are many threads about this design on Vintage-Radio.net.

My many thanks to his original work.

For my part I have designed a PCB to allow you to build this project with greater ease.

The various versions, released over time, can be found in the sub folders listed.

The circuit and artwork are also published on https://oshwlab.com/mycoopzone/test_copy
